# PVector
Two dimensional Vector mathematics.

Contains basic vector functions such as: 
 - add() — add vectors
 - sub() — subtract vectors
 - mult() — scale the vector with multiplication
 - div() — scale the vector with division
 - mag() — calculate the magnitude of a vector
 - setMag() - set the magnitude of a vector
 - normalise() — normalize the vector to a unit length of 1
 - limit() — limit the magnitude of a vector
 - heading() — the 2D heading of a vector expressed as an angle
 - rotate() — rotate a 2D vector by an angle
 - lerp() — linear interpolate to another vector
 - dist() — the Euclidean distance between two vectors (considered as points)
 - angleBetween() — find the angle between two vectors
 - dot() — the dot product of two vectors
 - cross() — the cross product of two vectors (only relevant in three dimensions)
 - random2D() - make a random 2D vector
